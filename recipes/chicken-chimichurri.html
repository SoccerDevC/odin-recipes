    <h3>Finished Chicken chimichurri</h3>
    <p>Chicken tenders for a crowd cook up quickly in the oven, with fresh, herby flavor from chimichurri.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup packed fresh parsley leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped green onion (including green tops)</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 pounds chicken tenders</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12x18-inch sheet pan with parchment or aluminum foil; set aside. </li>
        <li>Combine parsley, oregano, garlic, green onions, and jalapeño in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse just a few times to break up the parsley and combine the ingredients. Place processed vegetables in a small bowl; stir in vinegar, lemon juice, and olive oil. Season with salt and black pepper. </li>
        <li>Place chicken tenders in a single layer on the prepared pan. Lightly season with salt and pepper; sprinkle smoked paprika evenly over the tenders. Spoon half of the chimichurri evenly over the tenders. Reserve remaining half of chimichurri, covered, in the refrigerator to use later. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Serve tenders with reserved chimichurri sauce. </li>
    </ol>
